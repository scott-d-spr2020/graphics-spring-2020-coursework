// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) declare structure to store single hierarchy node data
//		(hint: look in the framework)
//		(hint: char is not a thing here, but 1 int = 4 chars)
//	2) declare uniform block to read list of hierarchy nodes
//	3) select color from array based on some component of the 
//		current hierarchy node being drawn
//		(e.g. level in hierarchy from root node)
//	4) copy selected color to outbound color

	mat4 uMVP[MAX_INSTANCES];
};

out vec4 vColor;

void main()
{
	gl_Position = uMVP[gl_InstanceID] * aPosition;

	// DUMMY OUTPUT: select first color
