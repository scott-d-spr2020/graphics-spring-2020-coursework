// ****TO-DO: 
//	0) copy existing texturing shader
//	1) declare uniforms for pixel size and sampling axis
//	2) implement Gaussian blur function using a 1D kernel (hint: Pascal's triangle)
//	3) sample texture using Gaussian blur function and output result

uniform vec2 uAxis;

layout (location = 3) out vec4 rtTexCoord;

	rtTexCoord = vec4(outTexCoord, 0.0, 1.0);
