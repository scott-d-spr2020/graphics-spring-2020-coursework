// ****TO-DO: 
//	0) copy original forward Phong shader
//	1) declare g-buffer textures as uniform samplers
//	2) declare light data as uniform block
//	3) replace geometric information normally received from fragment shader 
//		with samples from respective g-buffer textures; use to compute lighting
//			-> position calculated using reverse perspective divide; requires 
//				inverse projection-bias matrix and the depth map
//			-> normal calculated by expanding range of normal sample
//			-> surface texture coordinate is used as-is once sampled
